Blog engine(CMS) on top of Codeigniter 3.04
###################

This is my attempt to build Blog engine with DRY(Dont Repeat Yourself) principle in mind.
Engine have dynamic menu picking, available to be configured from admin dashboard(current working just in firefox), also for articles to edit or to write new one article, i integrated tinymce, and jquery element for date picking. 
In near future i plan to integrate working search bar, comment section and edit ci_sessions table in database, that table would be appceptable for codeiginter 3 sessions, also replace jquery element for site menu edit because right now it is working just in firefox. 
  

to login intro admin dashboard enter http://localhost/cms-tvs/admin and enter
