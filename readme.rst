Blog engine(CMS) on top of Codeigniter 3.04
###################

This is my attempt to build Blog engine with DRY(Dont Repeat Yourself) principle in mind.
Engine have dynamic menu(current working just in firefox), available to be configured from admin dashboard, also for articles i integrated tinymce, and jquery element for date picking. 
In near future i plan to integrate working search bar, comment section and edit ci_sessions table in database, that table would be appceptable for codeiginter 3 sessions, also replace jquery nestes
sortable because right now it is working just in firefox. 
  

to login intro admin dashboard use (if you are using xampp) enter http://localhost/cms-tvs/admin and enter
